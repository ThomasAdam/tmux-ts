# tmux-ut
Runtime unit tests for tmux

This uses the [ts - test script](https://github.com/thinkerbot/ts) framework
to define a series of tests that can be run against tmux.

The idea is that this will form a series of tests to exercise problems and
help diagnose issues, both in terms of user issues and means to reproduce
segfaults, etc.  By augmenting these tests with those fixes and new
features, this should make tmux even better than it already is.

Any questions, email me, or find me in `#tmux` on freenode (`thomas_adam`)
