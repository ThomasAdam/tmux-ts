ts(1) limitations
=================

Consideration should be given as to whether ts(1) itself needs to support
these things:

* Separate out stdout/stderr into different variables, and provide a wrapper
  so that each test doesn't need to repeat the same command substitution
  over and over again.
* With '-d' the trace is output for tests which have passed; perhaps limit
  this to only tests which have failed.
* Provide a 'skip' test option.

Tests
=====

* Write all the tests!  Separate out into the following files
	- Session
	- Windows
	- Panes
	- Client
